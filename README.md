# ToDo Awesome List
A React app with Redux (and Node/MongoDB in the future).

This project is based on my previous one that was written in simple JS and PHP. You can <a href="https://github.com/ukasz1/PHP_TODO_list">find it here</a>ðŸ‘ˆ

## Goals
- Practicing React
- Gaining new skills in Redux
- Starting point for a fullstack MERN project (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS)

## Current state
- Graphic layout
- Gaining hardcoded data from the script
