# ToDo Awesome List (Front-end)
A React app with Redux and my own <a href="https://github.com/ukasz1/ToDo-Awesome-List-API">API</a>. The API is a separate project to work independently.

This project is based on my previous one that was written in simple JS and PHP. You can <a href="https://github.com/ukasz1/PHP_TODO_list">find it here</a>ðŸ‘ˆ

## Goals
- Practicing React
- Gaining new skills in Redux
- Starting point for a fullstack MERN project (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS)

## Current state
- Graphic layout
- Fetching data from the API
