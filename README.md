# ToDo Awesome List
A part of a MERN project. This is a React app with Redux.

See ðŸ‘‰[online here](https://todo-awesome-list.netlify.app/)ðŸ‘ˆ

This is my current project I'm working on right now. When finished, it will be a todo list for a single user. The app is going to show a planned activities, with its description and deadline. There is also a form for submitting new activities. The data will be stored in the database with using my <a href="https://github.com/ukasz1/ToDo-Awesome-List-API">own API</a>. The API is a separate project to work independently. 

This project is based on my previous one that was written in simple JS and PHP. You can <a href="https://github.com/ukasz1/PHP_TODO_list">find it here</a>ðŸ‘ˆ
